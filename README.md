## 🔍 Analysis Performed

### 1. Initial Data Analysis
- Checked dataset shape (rows and columns)
- Detected missing values
- Generated descriptive statistics

### 2. Item Analysis
- Extracted all unique items sold
- Calculated total quantity sold per item

### 3. Sales Performance Analysis

- Bottom 5 selling items

---

## 📊 Visualizations
- Top 5 Selling Items – Bar Chart
- Sales Contribution of Top 5 Items – Pie Chart
- Least Selling Items – Bar Chart
- Order Quantity Distribution – Histogram

---

## 💡 Key Business Insights
- A small number of items generate a large percentage of total sales
- Several items show low demand and increase operational costs
- Most customers purchase 1–2 items per order, indicating potential for combo offers

---

## 📈 Business Recommendations
- Promote high-performing menu items
- Remove, rebrand, or bundle low-selling items
- Introduce combo meals to increase average order value
- Optimize inventory based on demand patterns

## 💰 Revenue Analysis

### 📌 Revenue Calculation
Revenue was calculated at the item level using the formula:


A new column `revenue` was created to enable revenue-based analysis.

---

### 1️⃣ Top 5 Individual Revenue-Generating Items
- Grouped orders by `item_name`
- Summed total revenue for each item
- Sorted results in descending order
- Selected the top 5 revenue-generating items

These items represent the **primary revenue drivers** of the restaurant.

---

### 2️⃣ Total Revenue Generated by Top 5 Items
- Calculated the combined revenue contributed by the top 5 items
- This shows how much of the business revenue depends on a small set of products

This insight reflects the **Pareto Principle (80/20 rule)**, where a few items generate most of the revenue.

---

## 📊 Revenue-Based Insights
- A small number of items contribute a significant share of total revenue
- High-revenue items should be prioritized for promotions and inventory planning
- Low-revenue items may increase cost without proportional returns

---

## 🧠 Business Impact

- Identify profit-driving menu items
- Optimize pricing and promotion strategies
