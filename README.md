---

## 🔍 Analysis Performed

### 1. Initial Data Analysis
- Checked dataset shape (rows and columns)
- Detected missing values
- Generated descriptive statistics

### 2. Item Analysis
- Extracted all unique items sold
- Calculated total quantity sold per item

### 3. Sales Performance Analysis

- Bottom 5 selling items

---

## 📊 Visualizations
- Top 5 Selling Items – Bar Chart
- Sales Contribution of Top 5 Items – Pie Chart
- Least Selling Items – Bar Chart
- Order Quantity Distribution – Histogram

---

## 💡 Key Business Insights
- A small number of items generate a large percentage of total sales
- Several items show low demand and increase operational costs
- Most customers purchase 1–2 items per order, indicating potential for combo offers

---

## 📈 Business Recommendations
- Promote high-performing menu items
- Remove, rebrand, or bundle low-selling items
- Introduce combo meals to increase average order value
- Optimize inventory based on demand patterns

## 💰 Revenue Analysis

### 📌 Revenue Calculation
Revenue was calculated at the item level using the formula:


A new column `revenue` was created to enable revenue-based analysis.

---

### 1️⃣ Top 5 Individual Revenue-Generating Items
- Grouped orders by `item_name`
- Summed total revenue for each item
- Sorted results in descending order
- Selected the top 5 revenue-generating items

These items represent the **primary revenue drivers** of the restaurant.

---

### 2️⃣ Total Revenue Generated by Top 5 Items
- Calculated the combined revenue contributed by the top 5 items
- This shows how much of the business revenue depends on a small set of products

This insight reflects the **Pareto Principle (80/20 rule)**, where a few items generate most of the revenue.

---

## 📊 Revenue-Based Insights
- A small number of items contribute a significant share of total revenue
- High-revenue items should be prioritized for promotions and inventory planning
- Low-revenue items may increase cost without proportional returns

---

## 🧠 Business Impact
This analysis helps stakeholders:
- Identify profit-driving menu items
- Optimize pricing and promotion strategies
- Reduce inventory wastage
- Improve overall profitability

---


## ⭐ Note
This project demonstrates practical data analysis skills, clean coding practices, and business-oriented insights.

# 📘 Chapter 4 – Filtering, Selection & Sorting (Euro 2012)

## 📌 Chapter Overview
This chapter focuses on applying **filtering**, **column selection**, and **sorting techniques** using Pandas on the Euro 2012 football team statistics dataset. The goal is to extract meaningful insights related to team performance and discipline.

---

## 📂 Dataset Used
- File Name: `Euro_2012_stats_TEAM.csv`
- Dataset Type: Football Team Statistics
- Key Columns Used:
  - Team
  - Goals
  - Yellow Cards
  - Red Cards

---

## 🛠️ Concepts Covered
- Column selection
- Sorting data using single and multiple columns
- Filtering data using conditions
- Boolean indexing
- Applying logical operators (`>`, `>=`, `==`, `&`)

---

## 🔍 Analysis Performed

### 1️⃣ Column Selection
Selected only relevant columns (`Team`, `Goals`, `Yellow Cards`, `Red Cards`) to simplify analysis and improve readability.

---

### 2️⃣ Sorting Operations
- Sorted teams based on **Yellow Cards** in descending order
- Identified:
  - Top 5 teams with most Yellow Cards
  - Bottom 5 teams with least Yellow Cards

---

### 3️⃣ Filtering Conditions
- Listed teams that received **at least one Red Card**
- Listed teams that received **more than 8 Yellow Cards**

---

## 🧠 Additional Tasks & Insights

### ✅ New Analytical Questions Solved
1. Top 5 teams with highest number of goals  
2. Teams that received zero red cards  
3. Teams with more yellow cards than goals  
4. Teams sorted by red cards and yellow cards  
5. Teams with at least 5 goals and fewer than 5 yellow cards  

These tasks demonstrate real-world usage of filtering and sorting techniques.

---

## 💡 Key Insights
- Teams with higher goals are not always the most disciplined
- Some teams accumulated more cards than goals, indicating aggressive play
- Filtering and sorting help quickly identify performance and behavior patterns

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcome
By the end of this chapter, you can confidently:
- Filter datasets using conditions
- Select specific columns for focused analysis
- Sort data to rank performance metrics
- Apply Pandas techniques to real-world sports datasets

---

## ⭐ Note
This chapter is part of a hands-on Pandas learning series designed to build strong foundations in data analysis using real datasets.

## 📝 Notes – Missing Value Imputation

### 📌 Problem Statement
The dataset contained missing values in critical columns such as **Salary** and **Age**, which could negatively impact analysis or model training if left untreated.

---

### 🧠 Imputation Strategy Used

#### 1️⃣ Salary Imputation (Department-Based Logic)
- Missing salary values were imputed using the **average salary of the respective department**
- Departments considered:
  - Support
  - IT Tech
  - Ops
- This approach maintains **internal salary consistency** within departments and avoids bias caused by random value assignment

**Logic Applied:**

---

#### 2️⃣ Age Imputation (Business-Provided Value)
- The employee **Matthew** had a missing age value
- Based on confirmed business input, Matthew’s age was imputed as **27**
- This is an example of **manual imputation using domain knowledge**

---

### ✅ Validation Checks
- Verified missing values before and after imputation using `isnull().sum()`
- Ensured no unintended changes to other records
- Confirmed dataset integrity after updates

---

### 💡 Why This Approach Is Used
- Preserves data distribution
- Avoids data loss from dropping records
- Aligns with real-world data cleaning practices
- Ensures dataset is ready for analysis or model training

---

### 🎯 Learning Outcome
From this task, the following concepts were applied:
- Handling missing values using conditional filtering
- Department-based mean imputation
- Record-level manual imputation
- Data validation after cleaning

---

### ⭐ Note
Proper documentation and client approval are essential before applying imputation techniques in real-world projects, especially when dealing with employee or sensitive data.
